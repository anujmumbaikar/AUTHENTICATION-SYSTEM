# üîê Advanced Authentication System

A full-featured **authentication system** built with **Next.js**, **NextAuth**, **PostgreSQL (NeonDB)**, **Prisma**, **Zod**, **Nodemailer**, and **ShadCN** UI.  
It supports:

- ‚úÖ Email Verification (via Gmail)
- üîê Password Reset (Secure Token Flow)
- üì© OTP-based 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)
- üì¶ Session & JWT Management
- üåê OAuth (Google & GitHub)
- üõ°Ô∏è Credentials Login (with secure email verification)
- üîí OAuth users are treated as verified by default
- üîè Passwords are **stored only for OAuth users**, not for credential users.

---
## Workflow
```bash
1.OAuth Users: Users logging in with Google or GitHub are automatically marked as verified. No password is stored initially.
2.Credentials Users: Must verify their email via a Gmail verification link before they can log in. Only after successful verification is the user allowed to set a password and access the app.
3.JWT & Sessions: Fully handled via NextAuth.js (you can choose between jwt or database sessions).
4.OTP/2FA: 2FA via email-based OTP is available and can be enabled per user. This adds an extra layer of security to the login process.
5.Forgot Password: Users who forget their password can initiate a password reset flow.A Gmail verification link is sent to their email to securely update their password.
```
